                A new evidence – based field in medicine that blends the art of
                cooking with the science of medicine’. Medical students are
                taught the health promoting properties of food by way of
                <br />
                hands on cookery and nutrition classes. It is a deeply practical
                way for clinicians to engage with their patients. The aim is to
                improve the confidence of clinicians to transfer this knowledge
                to patients in a range of clinical contexts.

                Nutritank helped to facilitate the introduction of Dr Rupy
                Aujla’s pioneering Culinary Medicine UK course for medical
                students. This was piloted at Bristol medical school in July
                2019 as a 4 week course as part of the 3rd year student selected
                component. Nutritank co-founders Ally and Iain took part in the
                course alongside many Nutritanksoc. Bristol members.
