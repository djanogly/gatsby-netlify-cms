            â€œWith the increasing burden of chronic lifestyle-related disease in
            the UK, it is vital that our future doctors be well trained in
            evidence-based Nutrition and Lifestyle measures and interventions.
            Such preventive medicine should begin at birth, with medical
            professionals emphasising healthy living messages at every stage of
            life, and empowering patients and their families to maintain
            positive lifestyle changes. I wholly support Nutritank in making it
            their goal to give all medical students a firm foundation in these
            principles."{" "}
