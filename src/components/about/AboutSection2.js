              Founded by two current medical students, our focus is medical
              education. <br />{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Through Nutritank’s university society branches “Nutritanksoc’s”,
              we aim to promote the need for greater nutrition and lifestyle
              medicine training within medical education. <br />{" "}

            <p>
              Originating at Bristol Medical School, Nutritank has achieved a
              growing momentum across the UK, from the development of these
              Nutritank society branches at over 20 medical schools, to online
              and social media engagement and the curation of key projects on a
              local and national scale. <br />{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Nutritank’s think tank is a member of an inter-professional
              working group tasked by the General Medical Council (GMC) to
              ensure more nutrition education is integrated within UK
              undergraduate medical school curricula.

            <p>
              Through Nutritank’s online community hubs and toolbox it aims to
              further promote the message of nutrition in medical lifestyle
              education not only to healthcare professionals and students, but
              also interested members of the public. This is vital, as lifestyle
              medicine really does depend on the engagement and empowerment of
              patients.

              We have some exciting things in development too. Soon we aim to
              provide a range of fantastic benefits for paid Nutritank members,
