                â€œInspire future doctors to use lifestyle medicine in daily
                practice, so patients can regain leadership of their health and
                body. That is the mission of the Student and Nutrition
                Foundation, an initiative of Dutch medical students. They
                started two years ago to improve the knowledge and skills of
                medicals students on food, lifestyle and productivity management
                with the aim to implement these subjects in their study
                programme. These days all eight medical faculties in the
                Netherlands are involved to make a transition in the current
                medical system. The young generation of doctors is ready to have
                deep impact at a level of their own lives, the lives of others
                and public health.

                Society cries out: who provides sufficient knowledge on food,
                lifestyle and productivity management? How can I take
                responsibility of my own body? Are there alternatives for all
                the pills flying of the shelf? Are there opportunities to get
                rid of my medication? Can I be free of the medical diagnosis I
                got in the past? Where can I find physicians who can provide me
                with solid information? Who offers me some direction in the
                wilderness, called social media? The amount of lifestyle
                coaches, food bloggers and personal trainers is increased
                rapidly in the last five years. The alternatives for medical
                practice and science-based advices are very popular. What is the
                prize the medical profession pays for all these people searching
                for a real solution to their problems? What is our answer to the
                growing population of chronic ill patients?"
