                The club was officially established in December 2016. In the
                first year of its activity, the club undertook a number of
                initiatives promoting, mostly among medical students, healthy
                lifestyle as a crucial element of prevention and effective
                treatment for non-communicable diseases. At the beginning, Club
                focused mostly on the importance of nutrition. In May, it
                co-organized (supporting the International Federation of Medical
                Students’ Associations IFMSA-Poland LC Warsaw) the second
                edition of Food Medicine Conference with Evidence-Based
                student-led Lifestyle Medicine Report Session. It also led a
                campaign ‘Plant-Based MUW’ promoting whole-food, plant-based
                diet providing not only scientific background but also practical
                tools for its implementation.
