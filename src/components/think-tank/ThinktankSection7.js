                      then refer on APPROPRIATELY to nutritionists and

                      Motivational interviewing is at the heart of this. It is
                      paramount to meet the patient in the middle and relate the
                      information to their current routine. Common examples of
                      this in clinical practice is for doctors to advise: - food
                      substitutions and beneficial add-ons to increase the
                      nutritional density of meals, e.g. can you add lentils
                      into dish to make it more nutritionally dense? Can you get
                      some extra steps in during your morning commute? e.g.
                      getting off the tube one stop earlier. Can you find 5-10
                      minutes of relaxation a day such as; a walk through a
                      park, engaging with green space or doing a mindfulness
                      practice. Can you try and have a tech curfew and not look
                      at a screen past a certain time?

                      Previous efforts to roll out a new nutritional education
                      curriculum have been curtailed by the fact that it was not
                      made obligatory by the GMC for medical schools to
                      introduce it into their independent curricula. That means
                      it was not disseminated and applied to education practice.
                      Obtaining voluntary buy-in from decision makers on an
                      individual level is therefore paramount.

                      Despite sensationalist media headlines which have led to
                      pubic confusion and misconception around nutritional
                      science, we have found that, there is in fact a general
                      consensus surrounding which food is most beneficial to
                      health. We don’t know everything about nutrition, and much
                      is still being discovered, for instance the new studies
                      around gut health and the microbiome. However, there is
                      enough scientific fact around food, to benefit patient
                      care, that the time for action and innovation is now.

                      Whilst nutrition falls under the umbrella of Lifestyle
                      medicine, we believe that Nutrition is its own entity and
                      should be prioritised as the first call to action.
                      Firstly, it has the most misinformation and tension
                      surrounding it. Secondly because the subject of the
                      science, being food, intersects with just about every
                      aspect of society, from cultural beliefs to socioeconomic
                      status. It’s complex and multi-faceted. However, we would
                      rather do something, rather than nothing. Therefore, we
                      are starting with education and we want to empower as many
                      individuals to initiate the conversation around nutrition
                      and lifestyle medicine.
